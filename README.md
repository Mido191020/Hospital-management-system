# Hospital-management-system
The hospital management system project is designed to manage the patient data of a hospital. The system maintains the records of all the patients admitted to the hospital, including their personal information, such as name, age, gender, and date of admission. It also manages the availability of beds in the hospital.

The Hospital class contains a list of patients and the number of available beds. It provides methods to add a new patient, display all patient information, search for a specific patient by name or other information, and release a patient from the hospital.

The Patient class contains the personal information of each patient, including their name, age, gender, and date of admission. It provides methods to access and modify this information.

The system aims to simplify the process of managing patient data for hospital staff and provide a centralized repository for all patient-related information. With this system, hospital staff can easily add, search, and release patients, and keep track of the availability of beds.
